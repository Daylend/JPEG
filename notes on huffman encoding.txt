Parse the values from the quantization array against the predefined huffman table and put the values into another array.
  
  
DC coefficient algo:
  DiffDC(i) = DC(i) - DC(i-1)
    --First one is just itself.
  var prevdc
  var curdc
  var curdcpos
  loop (condition)
   dc = curdc - prevdc
   curdc = prevdc

AC coefficients Algo:
  Cycle until value >0, increment zerocount each iteration
  If found non-zero stop and encode value against the predefined huffman table using run/category of the two pair values.
  Place into array of unique identifiers.
  Repeat until end of quantization table, if no other non-zero found insert 0,0 pair.
